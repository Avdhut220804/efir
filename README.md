   - **Super Users (Judiciary and Police)**: Access and manage complaints with automated notifications, classified dynamically from the optimized database.

2. **Enhanced Security**
   - **Token-Based Authentication**: Secure sessions using JWT, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the system.
   - **Base64 Encryption**: Protect sensitive information, including digital evidence, with advanced encryption techniques.
   - **Socket-Based OTP Validation**: Secure login and actions with OTP verification, adding an extra layer of security.
   - **bcryptJS**: Encrypts digital evidence, ensuring data integrity and protection.

3. **Generative AI Integration**
   - **Legal Advice**: Leverage generative AI to provide users with preliminary legal advice, streamlining the decision-making process.
   - **Smart Filtering**: Automate the classification and filtering of complaints, allowing super users to handle cases more efficiently.

4. **Intuitive User Interface**
   - **User-Centric Design**: Developed with React, the UI is designed to enhance user engagement and productivity.
   - **Modularized Components**: Optimized performance and reduced bundle size by modularizing components, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

5. **Efficient Notification System**
   - **NodeMailer**: Automates email notifications, keeping users and super users informed of complaint statuses and updates.

6. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Automated Response Time Reduction**: Gemini AI automates processes to reduce response times, enhancing system efficiency and user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Frontend:
- **ReactJS**: Powers the dynamic and responsive user interface, enhancing user engagement.
- **Gemini AI**: Integrates generative AI for smart filtering, legal advice, and automated processes.
